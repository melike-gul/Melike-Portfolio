*About the Project*

Melike Portfolio is a personal project designed to showcase my web development abilities. It features a clean and modern layout that highlights my skills, projects, and contact information. The site is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring a responsive design that works well on various devices. Through this portfolio, I aim to effectively communicate my expertise and the services I can offer to potential employers and clients.
